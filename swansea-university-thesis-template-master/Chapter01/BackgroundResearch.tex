In this section, a literature review is firstly introduced to present the most relevant works to this project. In the second part, previous systems in similar project is introduced. The third part provides an detailed analysis of the data characteristics.

\subsection{Literature Review}
This section introduced principles and techniques for data preprocessing and text data visualization.

Text Visualisation Browser \cite{Kucher2014} is an online tool providing the most comprehensive summary of published text visualization \cite{Cao2016}. According to Text Visualisation Browser, from 1976 to 2017, there are 400 published text visualisation papers in total, in which 396 publications are aim to analyse text alignment. By searching "Word", there shows 20 publications, and "Translation" gets 16 results. Whereas when typing "Frequency" and "Weighting", each key word get 1 results. Also, key words such as "Machine learning, "Data Mining", "Natural Language Processing" got no publication collected. The results indicate that in text visualization domain, most researches focus on presenting alignment of texts. There are certain amounts of research focus on the topic such as "word analysis" and "translation", which is similar with this project. However, applying more specific techniques such as "Natural Language Processing" haven't been applied in text visualisation widely.

\paragraph[]{}Work of \cite{Jong2008} provide a interactive visualization tool, MultiVersioner, to address the issues of comparing several versions of texts.

\subsection{Previous Systems}

In this section, interactive visualization of previsous system are introduced. For each research, data set and visualization techniques will be presented. Also, closely related work will be discussed in this section.
