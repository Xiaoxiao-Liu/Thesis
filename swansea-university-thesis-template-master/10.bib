abstract = {Textual data is at the forefront of information management problems today. One response has been the development of visualizations of text data. These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text.},

abstract = {Recognized as great works of world literature, Shakespeare's poems and plays have been translated into dozens of languages for over 300 years. Also, there are many re-translations into the same language, for example, there are more than 60 translations of Othello into German. Every translation is a different interpretation of the play. These large quantities of translations reflect changing culture and express individual thought by the authors. They demonstrate wide connections between different world regions today, and reveal a retrospective view of their cultural, intercultural, and linguistic histories. Researchers from Arts and Humanities at Swansea University are collecting a large number of transla-tions of William Shakespeare's Othello. In this paper, we have developed an inter-active visualization system to present, analyze and explore the variations among these different translations. Our system is composed of two parts: the structure-aware Treemap for document selection and meta data analysis, and Focus + Con-text parallel coordinates for in-depth document comparison and exploration. In particular, we want to learn more about which content varies highly with each translation, and which content remains stable. We also want to form hypotheses as to the implications behind these variations. Our visualization is evaluated by the domain experts from Arts and Humanities.},

abstract = {William Shakespeare is one of the world's greatest writers. His plays have been translated into every major living language. In some languages, his plays have been retranslated many times. These translations and retranslations have evolved for about 250 years. Studying variations in translations of world cultural heritage texts is of cross-cultural interest for arts and humanities researchers. The variations between retranslations are due to numerous factors, including the differing purposes of translations, genetic relations, cultural and intercultural influences, rivalry between translators and their varying competence. A team of Digital Humanities researchers has collected an experimental corpus of 55 different German retranslations of Shakespeare's play, Othello. The retranslations date between 1766 and 2010. A sub-corpus of 32 retransla-tions has been prepared as a digital parallel corpus. We would like to develop methods of exploring patterns in variation between different translations. In this article, we develop an interactive focus + context visuali-zation system to present, analyse and explore variation at the level of user-defined segments. From our visualization, we are able to obtain an overview of the relationships of similarity between parallel segments in different versions. We can uncover clusters and outliers at various scales, and a linked focus view allows us to further explore the textual details behind these findings. The domain experts who are studying this topic evaluate our visualizations, and we report their feedback. Our system helps them better understand the rela-tionships between different German retranslations of Othello and derive some insight.},

The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems. IGV is freely available for download from http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv, under a GNU LGPL open-source license.},
