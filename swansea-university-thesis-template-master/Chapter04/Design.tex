 The design starts with a list of classes and their responsibili- ties. This is a very important starting point (the list of classes and descriptions). It forces the programmer to start thinking about implementation.
 After identifying a list of candidate classes and writing a short description of each of them, e.g., 3â€“4 sentences, the list is reviewed with the project supervisor before proceeding onwards with the description of relationships between them.
