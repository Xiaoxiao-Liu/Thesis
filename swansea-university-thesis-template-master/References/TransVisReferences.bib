abstract = {Recognized as great works of world literature, Shakespeare's poems and plays have been translated into dozens of languages for over 300 years. Also, there are many re-translations into the same language, for example, there are more than 60 translations of Othello into German. Every translation is a different interpretation of the play. These large quantities of translations reflect changing culture and express individual thought by the authors. They demonstrate wide connections between different world regions today, and reveal a retrospective view of their cultural, intercultural, and linguistic histories. Researchers from Arts and Humanities at Swansea University are collecting a large number of transla-tions of William Shakespeare's Othello. In this paper, we have developed an inter-active visualization system to present, analyze and explore the variations among these different translations. Our system is composed of two parts: the structure-aware Treemap for document selection and meta data analysis, and Focus + Con-text parallel coordinates for in-depth document comparison and exploration. In particular, we want to learn more about which content varies highly with each translation, and which content remains stable. We also want to form hypotheses as to the implications behind these variations. Our visualization is evaluated by the domain experts from Arts and Humanities.},

They serve as a useful starting point for students (and new advisers) in their third or fourth year of study in the Computer Science Department of a UK-based university. Afterall, no one is born knowing how to write a dissertation. Yet, there are certain elements, a commonality, that can be found in virtually all good dissertations. We give our recommendations as to each section a good dissertation consists of as well as what each section contains. These guidelines are generic and can be customized to fit most projects. The guidelines are open and free to use at any university or institution without permission. We believe that the writing can start with the abstract, however, in practice writing usually starts with the background section. The abstract can be approximately 6â€“12 sentences.

abstract = {William Shakespeare is one of the world's greatest writers. His plays have been translated into every major living language. In some languages, his plays have been retranslated many times. These translations and retranslations have evolved for about 250 years. Studying variations in translations of world cultural heritage texts is of cross-cultural interest for arts and humanities researchers. The variations between retranslations are due to numerous factors, including the differing purposes of translations, genetic relations, cultural and intercultural influences, rivalry between translators and their varying competence. A team of Digital Humanities researchers has collected an experimental corpus of 55 different German retranslations of Shakespeare's play, Othello. The retranslations date between 1766 and 2010. A sub-corpus of 32 retransla-tions has been prepared as a digital parallel corpus. We would like to develop methods of exploring patterns in variation between different translations. In this article, we develop an interactive focus + context visuali-zation system to present, analyse and explore variation at the level of user-defined segments. From our visualization, we are able to obtain an overview of the relationships of similarity between parallel segments in different versions. We can uncover clusters and outliers at various scales, and a linked focus view allows us to further explore the textual details behind these findings. The domain experts who are studying this topic evaluate our visualizations, and we report their feedback. Our system helps them better understand the rela-tionships between different German retranslations of Othello and derive some insight.},

However, the size and diversity of the data sets produced by today's sequencing and array-based profiling methods present major challenges to visualization tools. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems. IGV is freely available for download from http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv, under a GNU LGPL open-source license.},

@article{Schmidt2009,
abstract = {The digitisation of cultural heritage and linguistics texts has long been troubled by the problem of how to represent overlapping structures arising from different markup perspectives ('overlapping hierarchies') or from different versions of the same work ('textual variation'). These two problems can be reduced to one by observing that every case of overlapping hierarchies is also a case of textual variation. Overlapping textual structures can be accurately modelled either as a minimally redundant directed graph, or, more practically, as an ordered list of pairs, each containing a set of versions and a fragment of text or data. This 'pairs-list' representation is provably equivalent to the graph representation. It can record texts consisting of thousands of versions or perspectives without becoming overloaded with data, and the most common operations on variant text, e.g. comparison between two versions, can be performed in linear time. This representation also separates variation or other overlapping structures from the document content, leading to a simplification of markup suitable for wiki-like web applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Textual data is at the forefront of information management problems today. One response has been the development of visualizations of text data. These visualizations, commonly based on simple attributes such as relative word frequency, have become increasingly popular tools. We extend this direction, presenting the first visualization of document content which combines word frequency with the human-created structure in lexical databases to create a visualization that also reflects semantic content. DocuBurst is a radial, space-filling layout of hyponymy (the IS-A relation), overlaid with occurrence counts of words in a document of interest to provide visual summaries at varying levels of granularity. Interactive document analysis is supported with geometric and semantic zoom, selectable focus on individual words, and linked access to source text.},

We cover " Bonferroni's Principle, " which is really a warning about overusing the ability to mine data. This chapter is also the place where we summarize a few useful ideas that are not data mining but are useful in un-derstanding some important data-mining concepts. These include the TF.IDF measure of word importance, behavior of hash functions and indexes, and iden-tities involving e, the base of natural logarithms. Finally, we give an outline of the topics covered in the balance of the book.},

Hoy en d{\'{i}}a la visualizaci{\'{o}}n de datos puede considerarse como un campo acad{\'{e}}mico consolidado y la mayor parte de esos datos est{\'{a}} en formato de texto. Pero es necesario hacer un an{\'{a}}lisis de textos de aplicaciones t{\'{i}}picas (analizar o comparar textos literarios, analizar secuencias de datos o, m{\'{a}}s recientemente, descubrir patrones en el comportamiento de los consumidores o el fraude en el uso de tarjetas de cr{\'{e}}dito. Las t{\'{e}}cnicas de visualizaci{\'{o}}n mejoran los resultados obtenidos con el an{\'{a}}lisis haci{\'{e}}ndolos usables e interactivos. Para ello se diferencian los textos individuales y las colecciones de texto. Tras un minucioso an{\'{a}}lisis de casos de visualizaci{\'{o}}n de textos se lleg{\'{o}} a las siguientes conclusiones: la literatura y textos complejos como los discursos pol{\'{i}}ticos o la Biblia tienen un alto nivel de abstracci{\'{o}}n y poca estructura predefinida por lo que se propone usar una herramienta de seguimiento de nuevos t{\'{e}}rminos introducidos a lo largo de un texto. La visualizaci{\'{o}}n de parte de un texto es m{\'{a}}s popular ya que, por ejemplo, una lista de varios tama{\~{n}}os de palabras que siguen un patr{\'{o}}n es una forma directa de comunicarse con cualquier usuario. Las visualizaciones de colecciones de textos utilizan m{\'{e}}todos que se pueden encontrar en la visualizaci{\'{o}}n de datos en general, ya que seg{\'{u}}n los estudios realizados, un gran n{\'{u}}mero de elementos crea problemas visuales de superposici{\'{o}}n. Los diez m{\'{e}}todos que existen actualmente para representar colecciones de textos tienen en com{\'{u}}n que no est{\'{a}}n representando {\'{i}}tems espec{\'{i}}ficos; algunos de ellos son herramientas que sirven para comprender y comparar los relatos, otras identifican ediciones o escritores y destacamos dotplot, herramienta cuyo uso principal es la comparaci{\'{o}}n de textos, incluyendo textos multi-idioma, comparaci{\'{o}}n de versiones de texto y comparaci{\'{o}}n de c{\'{o}}digos de pro-gramaci{\'{o}}n.},
