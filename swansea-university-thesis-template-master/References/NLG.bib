abstract = {This book explains how to build Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems - computer software systems which use techniques from artificial intelligence and computational linguistics to automatically generate understandable texts in English or other human languages, either in isolation or as part of multimedia documents, Web pages, and speech output systems. Typically starting from some non-linguistic representation of information as input, NLG systems use knowledge about language and the application domain to automatically produce documents, reports, explanations, help messages, and other kinds of texts. The book covers the algorithms and representations needed to perform the core tasks of document planning, microplanning, and surface realization, using a case study to show how these components fit together. It also discusses engineering issues such as system architecture, requirements analysis, and the integration of text generation into multimedia and speech output systems.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare expert-generated textual summaries of physiological data with trend graphs, in terms of their ability to support neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff in making decisions when presented with medical scenarios. METHODS: Forty neonatal ICU staff were recruited for the experiment, eight from each of five groups--junior, intermediate and senior nurses, junior and senior doctors. The participants were presented with medical scenarios on a computer screen, and asked to choose from a list of 18 possible actions those they thought were appropriate. Half of the scenarios were presented as trend graphs, while the other half were presented as passages of text. The textual summaries had been generated by two human experts and were intended to describe the physiological state of the patient over a short period of time (around 40 minutes) but not to interpret it. RESULTS: In terms of the content of responses there was a clear advantage for the Text condition, with participants tending to choose more of the appropriate actions when the information was presented as text rather than as graphs. In terms of the speed of response there was no difference between the Graphs and Text conditions. There was no significant difference between the staff groups in terms of speed or content of responses. In contrast to the objective measures of performance, the majority of participants reported a subjective preference for the Graphs condition. CONCLUSIONS: In this experimental task, participants performed better when presented with a textual summary of the medical scenario than when it was presented as a set of trend graphs. If the necessary algorithms could be developed that would allow computers automatically to generate descriptive summaries of physiological data, this could potentially be a useful feature of decision support tools in the intensive care unit.},

abstract = {STOP is a Natural Language Generation (NLG) system that generates short tailored smoking cessation letters, based on responses to a four-page smoking questionnaire. A clinical trial with 2553 smokers showed that STOP was not effective; that is, recipients of a non-tailored letter were as likely to stop smoking as recipients of a tailored letter. In this paper we describe the STOP system and clinical trial. Although it is rare for AI papers to present negative results, we believe that useful lessons can be learned from STOP. We also believe that the AI community as a whole could benefit from considering the issue of how, when, and why negative results should be reported; certainly a major difference between AI and more established fields such as medicine is that very few AI papers report negative results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The relationship between parents styles of talking about past events with their children and childrens recall of stressful events was explored. In this investigation, 2- to 5-year-old childrens recall of injuries requiring hospital emergency room treatment was assessed within a few days of the injury and again 2 years later, along with the way their parents reminisced with them about the event. Correlational analyses showed that age and parental reminiscing style were consistently related to child memory; regression analyses showed that although age was most important, parents who were more elaborative had children who recalled more during their initial interview about the harder- to-remember hospital event. Thus, an elaborative parental style may help childrens recall of even highly salient and stressful events.},

abstract = {The field of information visualization offers little methodological guidance to practitioners who seek to design novel systems. Though many sources describe the foundations of the domain, few discuss practical methods for solving visualization problems. One frequently cited guideline to design is the "Visual information-seeking mantra", proposed by Shneiderman in 1996. Although often used to inform the design of information visualization systems, it is unclear what use this has been for visualization designers. We reviewed the current literature that references the mantra, noting what authors have found useful about it and why they cite it. The results indicate a need for empirical validation of the mantra and for a method, such as design patterns, to inform a holistic approach to visualisation design.},

abstract = {In today's applications data is produced at unprecedented rates. While the capacity to collect and store new data grows rapidly, the ability to analyze these data volumes increases at much lower pace. This gap leads to new challenges in the analysis process, since analysts, decision makers, engineers, or emergency response teams depend on information "concealed" in the data. The emerging field of visual analytics focuses on handling massive, heterogenous, and dynamic volumes of information through integration of human judgement by means of visual representations and interaction techniques in the analysis process. Furthermore, it is the combination of related research areas including visualization, data mining, and statistics that turns visual analytics into a promising field of research. This paper aims at providing an overview of visual analytics, its scope and concepts, and details the most important technical research challenges in the field},

@article{Portet2009,
abstract = {Effective presentation of data for decision support is a major issue when large volumes of data are generated as happens in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Although the most common approach is to present the data graphically, it has been shown that textual summarisation can lead to improved decision making. As part of the BabyTalk project, we present a prototype, called BT-45, which generates textual summaries of about 45 minutes of continuous physiological signals and discrete events (e.g.: equipment settings and drug administration). Its architecture brings together techniques from the different areas of signal processing, medical reasoning, knowledge engineering, and natural language generation. A clinical off-ward experiment in a Neonatal ICU (NICU) showed that human expert textual descriptions of NICU data lead to better decision making than classical graphical visualisation, whereas texts generated by BT-45 lead to similar quality decision-making as visualisations. Textual analysis showed that BT-45 texts were inferior to human expert texts in a number of ways, including not reporting temporal information as well and not producing good narratives. Despite these deficiencies, our work shows that it is possible for computer systems to generate effective textual summaries of complex continuous and discrete temporal clinical data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier SAS.

Cognitive engineering is viewed, in this project, as a symbiosis between cognitive science and design practice. A range of methodologies has been used: interviews with neonatal staff, ward observations and experimental techniques. The results of these investigations are reported, focusing specifically on the differences between junior and senior physicians in their interpretation of monitored physiological data. It was found that the senior doctors made better use of the different knowledge sources available than the junior doctors. The senior doctors were able to identify more relevant physiological patterns and generated more and better inferences than did their junior colleagues. Expertise differences are discussed in the context of previous psychological research in medical expertise. Finally, the paper discusses the potential utility of these outcomes to inform the design of computerized decision support in neonatal intensive care.},
